Keymaps Information:

Svalboard keeps keymap_support.c up to date, with the most recent developments
on the board.  If you want to see an example keymap, look at the vial keymap.

You do not have to use vial with Svalboard, but the vial, and vial_secure
keymaps will be kept up to date, others may be out of date.

The API between Svalboard and a keymap may change over time.  Please feel
free to talk to us on Discord about changes you may need, or that have
impacted you.
