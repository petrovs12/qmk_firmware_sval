Timing on the double tap on the trackpoint:

Z Time Constant [zTc]
 This PtS parameter is the time constant of the running average of Z force.  Its units are in
 force sampling time units as specified in the Set Sampling Rate command on page 14.
 This determines how sharp a press has to be to be recognized.  The value of this parameter
 is 256/n, where n is the desired time constant.  The running average is then calculated with
 the formula:
  where A = running average, N = present sample, and X is
 A=A+(Nâˆ’A) X
 256
 zTc.  The default value for zTc is x"26" (decimal 38) corresponding to a time constant of
 6.7 samples.  This value is not affected by a reset (x"FF") or set default (x"F6") command
